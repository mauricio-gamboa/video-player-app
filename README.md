# Video Player App! (Optimized for mobile)

### User story
A user should be able to create a playlist, add videos to a playlist and play the videos continuously or by choosing from the playlist.

### Details
Create a simple form with artist, title and video url, which upon submitting would add the selected video to the playlist.

The video player should play continuously (when one video ends another one begins, when the playlist reaches an end it starts from the beginning).

Feel free to use any icons or fonts.

No server implementation should be needed.

### Purpose
All the implementation is in the hands of candidate. Here we would like to see your abilities in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, UI, Unit testing etc, if you feel the need to focus on a certain area then please feel free to do so. Feel free to use any of these, React, Angular or Vue.js, UI Frameworks, or just write Vanilla JS.

There is some open-endedness which means we can pick up on the strengths and weaknesses.

## Available Scripts

Important! Please install the node modules with `npm start` before running the scripts.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
